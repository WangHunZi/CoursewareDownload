**Writing Review Comments**

Try your best to provide friendly and constructive comments that may help the author to further improve the research proposal--even if you are not an expert in the research field. Even if you found that the paper has major flaws that impact its scientific contributions (e.g., lack of novelty and significance), please friendly indicate this.
If you find policy violation (e.g., exceeding page limit, wrong template, or plagiarism), you may desk reject this paper.
However, you should still give feedbacks as if the policy is not violated.

Specifically, you should evaluate the research proposal mainly based on soundness, novelty, and significance.
Try to act as a Program Committee member of a top conference (like ICSE/FSE).
The scores are:

* (strong) accept (+2)
* weak accept (+1)
* weak reject (-1)
* (strong) reject (-2)

Your review should contain the following three parts:

1. Paper summary in ~100 words. Use your own word to summarize the paper's major contents and contributions.
2. Strengths and weaknesses. List the points in bullets.
3. Detailed comments for author in ~500 words. Constructive comments for problems found and improvement suggestions for the paper.

You may search the Internet for more information, e.g., [Reviewing a technical paper by Michael Ernst](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/review-technical-paper.html).

**Writing Artifact Evaluation Comments**

You should try to install the required dependencies and run the author's software, probably with some real use cases (e.g., the test cases for your programming assignments). Write a short summary (100-300 words) about:

* Is documentation self-contained and clear?
* Does the tool follow the common practice of open-source software?
* Does the artifact work?
* Does it include unnecessary (generated) files?
* ...
