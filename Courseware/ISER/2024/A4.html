<h3>Improve Your Manuscript</h3>
<p>Revisit your research proposal with the mindset of a programmer analyzing code.
In this assignment, you (critically) refine and improve your research proposal by applying principles of “program analysis and synthesis”, with a focus on clarity, precision, and brevity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix any spelling or grammatical issues.</li>
<li>Improve the organization of your text, e.g., make topic sentences clearly conclude a paragraph.</li>
<li>Against Vagueness: Challenge yourself to identify any vague statements in your proposal. Rewrite your “statements” to be as specific and clear as possible, and avoid programming errors like use-without-definition.</li>
<li>Against Verbosity: Apply the principle of minimization to your writing. Eliminate redundant phrases, and any statement that does not add value to your proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may ask a peer to proof-read your research proposal. After revision, your proposal should look like a serious research paper. Specifically, you should take good care of different type of readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Junior-year undergraduates. They have some (but limited) background in programming, algorithms, and computer systems. You should try to convince them that you are trying to solve a really interesting problem with really exciting techniques.</li>
<li>Graduates, but from other areas in computer science. They can have their independent judgment of the quality of your research work.</li>
<li>Expert, but from other areas in computer science. They read a lot of papers. You should quickly impress them with your good work.</li>
<li>Your domain experts, maybe the author of a paper you cited. They are likely the most weighted reviewers in the program committee to decide whether your paper should be thrown away. They will have a quick and precise judgment of your research contributions. So don't irritate them!</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to make your article readable to all the above audiences. Don't worry about writing too much background-Your domain experts will skim your topic sentences and directly jump to your point. See the power of topic sentences!</p>
<p>Useful reference materials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jcsmith.people.clemson.edu/tips/Tips_Home.html">Writing Tips and Style Guidelines</a> (see the “general grammar” and “technical writing” parts)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">The Elements of Style</a> and <a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/">The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Policy on using large language models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permitted: You can ask a large language model to <em>revise</em> your manuscript to improve clarity, correct grammatical errors, etc. It is also encouraged to ask from large language models <em>why</em> they are making specific changes.</li>
<li>Not Permitted: You cannot ask a large language model to generate chunks of content based on a few rough ideas. This will generally result in a verbose paper.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Typeset with TeX</h3>
<p>Use the following document configurations:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-text">\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,anonymous]{acmart}
\acmConference[Introduction to SE Research]{The 2024 Introduction to Software Engineering Research at Nanjing University (ISER'24)}{2024}{Nanjing, China}
\setcopyright{none}
</code></pre>
<p>Reference format: <code>\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: you should <em>put your name and affiliation (English)</em> in the <code>\author{}</code> block. The instructors will keep a printed proceeding (for the non-anonymous version). Other instructions follow the same of the previous assignment: all proposals <em>must not exceed six pages</em> (single-column) for the main text (including figures, tables, and appendices). Additional pages containing only references are allowed.</p>
<h3>Typeset a Beautiful Paper</h3>
<p>Try your test to create a beautiful paper. Please refer to the texdoc of <code>acmart</code> (<code>texdoc acmart</code> in command line).
<a href="http://jcsmith.people.clemson.edu/tips/LaTeX.html">Here</a> is a link to common LaTeX issues. You may also find beautiful papers in POPL/PLDI/OOPSLA/ECOOP.
Another source to learn typesetting is from preprint sources on <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>.</p>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit a <em>zip</em>-format archive of source code. The document root should be named <code>main.tex</code> (any directory will be okay; but should only have one <code>main.tex</code>).</li>
<li>Build command: <code>latexmk -pdf main.tex</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you submit your manuscript, ensure that it can be compiled successfully by testing it with our online submission system. Please follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a zip archive containing all the necessary files for compilation.</li>
<li>Use the following <code>curl</code> command to upload your zip file to our server (replace the <code><stuid></code> with your student ID and <code><your-zip-file></code> with the path to your zip archive).<!-- -->
<pre><code class="hljs language-text">curl http://172.27.157.158:5000/submit -F stuid=<stuid> -F "file=@<your-zip-file>" --output result.zip
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>After the upload is complete, you will receive a <code>result.zip</code> file. This archive will contain two versions of your manuscript in PDF format: one anonymous and one non-anonymous.</li>
<li>Verify that your name is correctly displayed in the non-anonymous PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter any issues or have questions regarding the submission process, please contact the teaching assistant.</p></div></div><div class="bg-neutral-100 text-center text-neutral-600 dark:bg-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200 lg:text-left"><div class="bg-neutral-200 p-6 text-center dark:bg-neutral-700"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons License: BY-NC 4.0</a><br/><a href="https://beian.miit.gov.cn/">苏 ICP 备 2020049101 号</a></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h1: \"h1\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    em: \"em\",\n    pre: \"pre\",\n    code: \"code\",\n    strong: \"strong\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Box} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.h1, {\n      children: \"[A4] Research Proposal (Revision)\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(Box, {\n      title: \"Submission Deadline\",\n      logo: \"⚠️\",\n      children: _jsx(_components.p, {\n        children: \"CST 23:59:59 Dec 22, 2024.\\nThe deadline is firm.
